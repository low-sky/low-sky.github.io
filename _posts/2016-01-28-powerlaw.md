title: Power Laws and Mass Distributions
---

Many populations of astronomical objects follow power-law distributions in their proprties, also known as [Pareto distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution) to pretty much everyone else in the statistical world.  Of note the masses of stars produced by the star formation process follows an _initial mass function_ (IMF).  When first calculated, the functional form of the IMF appears to follow a power-law distribution, though subsequent work has started to argue about whether this is actually the case.  A reason for this debate is that physical processes, notably turbulence, can easily produce a [log-normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) distribution and it is difficult to distinguish between these two cases in the data.  Lately, it appears that turbulence produces the log-normal and then gravity amplifies the positive wing of the log-normal to create a power-law.  This leads to the truly awesome [power-law-log-normal distributions](http://www.math.uvic.ca/faculty/reed/dPlN.3.pdf) which are FINALLY getting some attention in astronomy (see [Basu et al.,  2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.449.2413B), [Brunt et al., ,2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.449.4465B)).

With that preamble aside, a major goal is to estimate the parameters of a power-law distribution given observed data.  Practically, we will be measuring the mass distributions of molecular clouds in a survey region.  The mass distribution (represented as the differential number of clouds per unit mass interval) can then be represented as [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function):
$$
\frac{dN}{dM} dM \equiv N_{\mathrm{tot}} p(M) dM = \beta \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{\alpha} d\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}
$$
where $$N_{\mathrm{tot}}$$ is the total number of clouds in the system.  The constant $$\beta$$ is a normalization constant and $$\alpha$ is called the index.  I like to define it to have no sign (because negative numbers are a thing), but many authors prefer to define it as positive number and include a negative sign in the formula.  For the classic [Salpeter IMF](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1955ApJ...121..161S) (a journal article with nearly 5000 citations), $$\alpha=-2.35$$.  For GMCs, the index has been shown to vary in (Rosolowsky (2005))[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005PASP..117.1403R] between $$\alpha = -2.5$$ to $$\alpha = -1.5$$ depending on the system under study.
