title: Astropy tables
---

A good way of keeping track of heterogeneous data is to use an [astropy table](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/).  This allows you to track a variety of different types of data in a single, manipulable format.  There are a bunch of other approaches to this from [python dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html) or fancy things like `PANDAS` [data frames](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html).  Astropy tables are good because they interface neatly with FITS binary tables, a common format in our field.  

You may, at some point want to create your own table-like data.  To build a table from scratch requires defining your own table structure.
