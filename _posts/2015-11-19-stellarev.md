title: Stellar Evolution Primer

In teaching stellar evolution for third year students, there are a few things that link tightly to the physics covered earlier in the class, and are worth highlighting.

## Evolution on the Main Sequence 

Stars on the main sequence are, by definition, fusing (1) hydrogen into helium (2) in their cores.  Low mass stars are fusing primarily through the $$pp$ chain and medium and high mass stars are fusing primarily through the CNO cycle.  Either way, the net effect of this fusion is to change the chemical composition in the core of the star from H into He.  Or, in terms of mass fractions, $$X$$ decreases toward 0, $$Y$$ increases toward $$1-Z$$.  This means that the mean particle mass is increasing:

$$\mu^{-1} = 2X + \frac{3}{4}Y + \frac{1}{2}Z$$.

Each  fusion chain reaction replaces four protons in the core with only one helium nucleus.  Since the gas pressure in a star is

$$ P = \frac{\rho k T}{\mu m_{\mathrm{H}}}$$,

the amount of pressure provided by a gas at density $$\rho$$ and temperature $$T$$ will decrease.  This means that the density and temperature of the core must increase to provide the pressure to support the star, increasing the nuclear energy generation rate and thus the luminosity.  Thus, stars on the main sequence are getting more luminous over their lifetimes.  The Sun formed with $$L=0.7 L_{\odot}$$ and will increase to about $$L=1.4 L_{\odot}$$ before it evolves off the main sequence.

## Low mass Stellar Evolution

Here we mean stars with masses $$ 0.8 M_{\odot} < M < 2 M_{\odot}$$.  

## Medium mass Stellar Evolution

For stars with masses $$ 2 M_{\odot} < M < 8 M_{\odot}$$, their evolution is similar to low mass stars, with the exception that there isn't the formation of a degenerate electron core and a proper red giant phase.
