title: Stellar Evolution Primer
---

In teaching stellar evolution for third year students, there are a few things that link tightly to the physics covered earlier in the class, and are worth highlighting.

## Evolution on the Main Sequence 

## Low mass Stellar Evolution

Here we mean stars with masses $$ 0.8 M_{\odot} < M < 2 M_{\odot}$$.  

## Medium mass Stellar Evolution

For stars with masses $$ 2 M_{\odot} < M < 8 M_{\odot}$$, their evolution is similar to low mass stars, with the exception that there isn't the formation of a degenerate electron core and a proper red giant phase.
