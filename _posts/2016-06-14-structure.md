title: Structures and Correlations
---

With a student, I've been working of developing structure function and correlation function approach to analyzing spectral line data cubes.  First, we've been working with the structure function of order $$p$$:

$$
S_p(\mathbf{\delta r},\delta v) = \left\langle \left|I(\mathbf{r},v)-I(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{\delta r},v+\delta v) \right|\right\rangle_{\mathbf{x}}
$$
