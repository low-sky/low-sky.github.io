title: Calibrating ARGUS data with pipelines
---

This is an outline of the calibration pipeline for processing ARGUS data taken with the GBT. The pipeline approach relies on two packages that I maintain:

   * `gbtpipe` ([link](https://github.com/low-sky/gbtpipe/tree/master/gbtpipe)) -- An installable version of the GBT pipeline (developed by NRAO/GBO and forked from [here](https://github.com/nrao/gbt-pipeline)). This provides useful sets of routines for calibration from the observatory library. The python module _also_ provides a gridder for on-the-fly spectroscopic data.
   * `degas` ([link](https://github.com/low-sky/degas/) -- The calibration pipeline package developed for the DEGAS survey. This actually does the calibration using the tools developed in `gbtpipe` and the strategy used for DEGAS.
