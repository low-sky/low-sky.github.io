title: Getting Started

This is a summary of how to get started in my research group.  At present, we use a few different technologies for carrying out our science and for documenting what we do.  Of note, we will be using python and several packages in a standard python distribution.  This allows us to analyze numerical data using a suite of Extremely Useful packages.  We will also use a version control system called git.  Git allows us to develop software collaboratively and keep a good record of how the projects are proceeding.  This document is an introduction to these two packages.

## Python

We will need to download and install a python distribution.  Every user has their own python distribution, which allows you to use whatever packages in python are necessary for your work.  Our industry-standard approach is to download the Anaconda python distribution, which bundles all the really important parts of the python universe into one place.  The package can be downloaded from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
