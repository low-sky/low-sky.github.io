title: Getting Started

This is a summary of how to get started in my research group.  At present, we use a few different technologies for carrying out our science and for documenting what we do.  Of note, we will be using python and several packages in a standard python distribution.  This allows us to analyze numerical data using a suite of Extremely Useful packages.  We will also use a version control system called git.  Git allows us to develop software collaboratively and keep a good record of how the projects are proceeding.  This document is an introduction to these two packages.  All this will usually operate on a linux server, and I've put an introduction to linux servers [here](http://low-sky.github.io/linux/).

## Python

We will need to download and install a python distribution.  Every user has their own python distribution, which allows you to use whatever packages in python are necessary for your work.  Our industry-standard approach is to download the Anaconda python distribution, which bundles all the really important parts of the python universe into one place.  The package can be downloaded from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).   If you right-click on the link and copy the link in your web-browser, you can usually paste the file into the command line.  We'll want to download the file using the command `wget` ("web get", I guess).  When I wrote this, you can also get the links [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/index.html).  You can then run the installer with the `source` command.

```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-2.4.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda2-2.4.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
or on a Mac

```
curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-2.4.1-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
open Anaconda2-2.4.1-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
```

Make sure you change the location of the python install to be a place where you have ample room.  At the end of the installation process, the script may ask if you want to append the startup commands to your `.bashrc` file.  You will want to say "yes" so that the version of python you use is the one that you just installed.
