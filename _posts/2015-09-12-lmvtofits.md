title: LMV to FITS
---

The documentation to [CLASS](https://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/class-html/class.html) is opaque.  Thus, trying to find how to convert LMV to FITS files is tricky.  Adam Ginsburg solved this, of course, and I simply consulted the [Codex Ginsburgium](http://keflavich.blogspot.ch/2010/12/converting-gildas-class-data-cubes-lmv.html).  

To wit:

```
vector\fits outfile.fits from infile.lmv
```
