title: Errata in Essential Astrophysics
---

I've adopted Kenneth Lang's _Essential Astrophysics_ for my ASTRO 320 class at U. Alberta this year.  It has the wonderful feature of being relatively low cost owing to the University Library subscribing to the Springer eBooks.  Thanks, Library.  Unfortunately, the book is a First Edition.
