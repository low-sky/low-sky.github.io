title: Errata in Essential Astrophysics
---

I've adopted Kenneth Lang's _Essential Astrophysics_ for my ASTRO 320 class at U. Alberta this year.  It has the wonderful feature of being relatively low cost owing to the University Library subscribing to the Springer eBooks.  Thanks, Library.  Unfortunately, the book is a First Edition.  As such there are typos.  Here is a list of the ones we've found so far.


#### Section 2.4, Page 45 
The Planck function is given as 
$$
\frac{2hn\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{\exp\left[h\nu/(kT)-1\right]
$$
where it should be 
$$
\frac{2hn\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{h\nu}{kT}\right)-1}
$$



#### Section 2.4, Page 45 
The value of $$\pi$$ is given as 3.13159 and should be 3.14159.

#### Section 2.4, Page 50 
The Stefan-Boltzmann Constant is given as $$5.6704\times 10^{-8}\mathrm{~W~m^{-2}~K^{4}}$$ and it should be $$5.6704\times 10^{-8}\mathrm{~W~m^{-2}~K^{-4}}$$
