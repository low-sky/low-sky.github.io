Astronomers pay attention to Molecular Clouds (MCs) since these complexes of molecular gas host all contemporary star formation.  Molecular gas is defined by the chemical state of hydrogen being $$\mathrm{H}_2$$.  However, at the typical $$T=10~\mathrm{ K}$$ temperatures of these clouds, such the molecular hydrogen emits no radiation.  Thus, we must use tracers to identify this gas.  There are many tracers available, but we focus on the emission of the CO molecule, which the usually the second-most-abundant molecule in the ISM after the $$\mathrm{H}_2$$.  CO gives of radiation through rotational quantum mechanical transitions between rotational energy levels specified by the quantum number $$J$$.  The lowest energy rotational transition is $$J=1\to 0$$ which gives off radiation at $$\nu = 115~\mathrm{ GHz} == 2.6~\mathrm{ mm}$$.  With $$h\nu / k \sim 5.5~\mathrm{ K}$$, this transition is easily observed in most molecular clouds.   We will use the shorthand CO(1-0) to indicate this particular radiation.  

Of note, this is spectral line radiation which is observed with millimetre-wave telescopes such as the [Nobeyama 45m](www.nro.nao.ac.jp/~nro45mrt/index-e.html), the [IRAM 30m](http://www.iram-institute.org/EN/30-meter-telescope.php), or [ALMA](http://almaobservatory.org).  These telescopes have excellent frequency resolution so that the centre and the width of the spectral line can be resolved, meaning that we can use the Doppler shift to measure how fast the cloud is moving towards us or away from as as well as the magnitude of the internal motions of the clouds.  When these telescopes make maps of the sky, every position is actually a spectrum as depicted in the figure below.

We will usually be discussing _Giant Molecular Clouds_ (GMCs).  The term _giant_ really means massive with my preferred qualifying divider between "ordinary" molecular clouds and "giant" clouds are clouds with mass $$M>10^5\ M_{\odot}$$.  This is not well defined in the literature, but I prefer this boundary since it is very roughly the scale of cloud required to form the highest mass stars.

The notion of GMCs became developed with the first extensive surveys of CO(1-0) 
 
[Solomon et al. (1987)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...319..730S) presented a foundational work in the study of molecular clouds.  It is one of a few landmark studies to be published in the late 1980s and I point to this since the approaches used in this work are the most relevant for this ongoing line of research.  This is a good article to read because it outlines the properties of molecular clouds.

However, in nearby galaxies, only the brightest emission is readily detected, meaning that the
