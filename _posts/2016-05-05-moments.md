title: A moment for Moments
---

When dealing with spectral line data cubes, we will often use moments as simple descriptions of the emission in the data set.   This is an aid to understanding what is happening inside the three dimensional data volume of the cube.  Let's set up a little formalism.  Consider the spectral line data cube to be a map of emission on the sky, with two spatial coordinates and one spectral coordinate.  Since moments only make sense when dealing with spectral _line_ data, let us further assume that the spectral coordinate is a line-of-sight velocity calculated from the Doppler formula.  Thus our cube is $$I(x,y,v)$$.  A single spectrum at position $$(x_0, y_0)$$ will be denoted $$S(v)$$, dropping the spatial coordinate for brevity.

If we look at a spectrum of a line, it will have a form like the figure below.

The line looks roughly like a Gaussian and the "jitter" seen off the line is instrumental noise (say, around $$v=4$$ km/s).  A compact way of describing the line would be to fit a Gaussian curve to it and simply describe the curve in terms of the three parameters of the fit, namely

$$
S_{\mathrm{fit}}(v) = A \exp\left[-\frac{(v-v_0)^2}{2\sigma_v^2}\right].
$$

The three fit parameters are $$A$$, the amplitude of the line, $$v_0$$ which is the centre of the line, and $$\sigma_0$$ which is a measurements of the line width.  These are annotated in the figure below.  The $$A$$ value will have units of the $$y$$-axis (here Kelvin).  The line centre ($$v_0$$) and line width ($$\sigma_0$$) will have the units of the $$x$$-axis (here km/s).

While we can fit this line, the non-linear regression of a Gaussian can be unstable and line profiles can also be messier, so we use _moments_ as a separate, complementary approach.  

_Warning:_ Remember that moment can be more susceptible to instrumental noise than Gaussian fits in estimating the parameters of the line.
