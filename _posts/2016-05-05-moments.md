title: A moment for Moments
---

When dealing with spectral line data cubes, we will often use moments as simple descriptions of the emission in the data set.   This is an aid to understanding what is happening inside the three dimensional data volume of the cube.  Let's set up a little formalism.  Consider the spectral line data cube to be a map of emission on the sky, with two spatial coordinates and one spectral coordinate.  Since moments only make sense when dealing with spectral _line_ data, let us further assume that the spectral coordinate is a line-of-sight velocity calculated from the Doppler formula.  Thus our cube is $$I(x,y,v)$$.  A single spectrum at position $$(x_0, y_0)$$ will be denoted $$S(v)$$, dropping the coordinate.
