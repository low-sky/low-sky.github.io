---

Here are a few questions about sky motions to give practice to students in first-year astronomy.  Recall that the latitude of Edmonton is $$53.5^{\circ}$$.

1. If I observe a star at zenith in Edmonton at 4:00 a.m., what will its altitude be when it is observed to be transiting from Phoenix, Arizona which has latitude 33.5$$\circ$$ N?
	* 70$$\circ$$ above the northern horizon.
2. On September 21st (today), what is the highest altitude the Sun will reach in Edmonton?
	* $$36.5^{\circ}$$.
3. On May 21st, the Sun transits at zenith for observers at a latitude of $$8^{\circ}$$S.  Would an observer at 80$$^{\circ}$$N see the Sun above the horizon at any point?
	* Yes (briefly around noon)
4. (setting Evil to MAXIMUM) If a total lunar eclipse was observed from Edmonton on December 21st at midnight, what would its altitude be?
	* $$60^{\circ}$$ above the southern horizon.
